   The GLobal airglOW (GLOW) model is a family of subroutines that calculates
ionization and excitation rates, energetic electron production and transport,
excited species densities, and airglow emission rates for the terrestrial
thermosphere.  Use is governed by the Open Source Academic Research License
Agreement contained in the file Glowlicense.txt.  Standards and practices are
specified by the "rules of the road" adopted by the CEDAR and TIMED programs.  
   Other than the example driver programs, the input files, Makefile, run
script, and possibly the master subroutine glow.f90, it is inadvisable to modify
the code.  If any changes are required, please suggest them to:

   Since this is a developmental code, there are bound to be problems which
users will uncover.  Please let me know about them.  I will also attempt to
accommodate any reasonable suggestions for enhancements or changes.  By
following this procedure, users will benefit by staying compatible with future
developments, and from a more systematic elimination of any progrmming errors.
Also, please upgrade to the latest version.  Use of obsolete versions may lead
to incorrect results.

   The main inputs to GLOW are: neutral thermopshere major species density
(O, O2, N2), minor species NO and N(4S), the electron density, the neutral,
ion, and electron temperatures, all on a 1D altitude grid, for specified
time and geographic coordinates.  Solar flux, and auroral electron flux, are
specified or calculated from parameters.  Outputs include electron density
calculated below 200 km, ionized and excited species density, airglow volume
emisison rates, and vertical column brightnesses.  Various parameters used
to calculate these are also available on output.  GLOW does not perform any
transport calculations, so above 200 km, the electron density must be
specified, since photochemical equilibrium is only valid to ~200 km altitude.
There are several other options for specifying ionospheric parameters.  GLOW
calculates dissociation rates, and will return N(2D), O(1D), etc., but not
N(4S), NO, or O(3P), since they are subject to transport.
  
   Program glowbasic.f90 is provided to give some guidance in using
the subroutine package, one profile at a time, similar to previous versions.
It uses NRLMSISE-00 and IRI-90 to specify the neutral atmosphere and
initial electron density profile, and the NOEM model to specify nitric oxide
density.  This program is intended as an example to be modified by the user
to suit particular purposes.  It is not necessary to use MSIS, IRI, and NOEM;
any model or measurement that specifies neutral densities, temperatures, and
high-altitude electron densities can be employed.  The output statements at the
end are just examples of a small subset of the calculated parameters.
To get started with glowbasic:
   cp Makefile.glowbasic Makefile
   gmake
   glow.exe < in.basic.day > test.basic.day
You don't need to use the Makefile or the input files, you can compile and
link manually, and run with command-line input.
You can also run glowbasic out of IDL using:
   spawn, '.glow.exe < input.file > output.file'

   Program glowdriver.f90 is a parallel processing program set up to use output
from general circulation models such as the NCAR TIE-GCM and TIME-GCM to
specify the neutral densities, electron density, and temperatures, and then
calculate airglow emissions globally on the GCM grid.  It uses
netCDF files for input and output, and a namelist input file to specify input
options.
   To run GLOW with TIE-GCM or TIME-GCM inputs, the GCM is run first, and a
secondary history file created.  This file must contain the output fields:
Zg, Te, Ti, Te, Ne, O2, O1, N2, NO, N4S, N2D,
and optionally the auroral parameters:
eflux, nflux, alfa, cusp, drizzle, ec, alfac, ed.
He, un, and vn anre also optional, which are not used by GLOW, but are passed
through to the output files. 

   Program glowdriver.f90 can also be run globally using MSIS/IRI
inputs.  Solar and auroral parameters are taken from the GCM histories when
running in GCM mode, and can be supplied by the user when in empirical mode,
although there is no way to provide auroral spatial distributions when running
in empirical mode at this time, so these would generally be omitted.
To use glowdriver:
   cp Makefile.glowdriver Makefile
   gmake
   runglow.job
You don't need to use the runglow.job script, you can use mpirun from the
command line.  The script is set up to use 6 processors, input from the
file in.namelist, netCDF output to a file specified by the namelist inputs,
and log messages to the file out.log.  The script can easily be edited to
change these.
  
   Subroutine GLOW is the master routine of the package.  It receives input
parameters from the calling program use associated through module CGLOW, calls
the other subroutines, and returns results through use associatedvariables.  Iti
is not necessary to use subroutine GLOW to call the others - those particularly
bold and well-informed users who desire to use some subset of the package
may attempt to do so, using subroutine GLOW as guidance. 

   The data files ephoto_x*.dat, ssflux_*.dat, and snoem_eof.dat are provided in
subdirectory data/ of the working directory.  Parameter files for IRI-90 are
provided in data/iri90/.  These files can put put in any directory as long as
their paths are correctly specified in the driver program or its namelist
inputs.  The number of wavelenth bins in the ephoto and ssflux files must equal
the parameter LMAX specified in module CGLOW, and the wavelength ranges must be
the same in all input files.
  
   These routines are written in standard Fortran-90 and MPI, and should be
compatible with most compilers.  However, their performace has only been tested
using the Intel ifort compiler with -O3 optimization running under CentOS Linux
on 64-bit machines.  The Portland Group compiler should also work but I haven't
been using it lately since ifort is faster.  I would be interested in hearing
of experiences with other compilers and/or operating systems, but make no claims
or promises.  To use with the glowdriver program, MPI and netCDF libraries must
be installed.  However, glowbasic shouldn't require anything other than Fortran.

A few notes:

   With version 0.98, GLOW now uses Fortran 90 conventions, including
use-associated variables defined in module CGLOW instead of in common blocks.
This was done for compatibility with parallel processing using MPI.  Most of the
routines were re-cast in free-form style, largely changed to lower case, and
have a ".f90" file extension suffix.  I am using a terminal column-width of 
100 characters for editing and 132 characters for tabular output.  There are
some routines still coded in fixed-format Fortan-77 style, including
exsect.f and fieldm.f.  The reason for this is that these two are due for an
overhaul and replacement, respectively, and it didn't seem worthwhile to
re-format them at this time.  (Subroutine exsect will ultimately be changed to
tablular data-file inputs instead of analytic functions, and fieldm will be
updated to IGRF/Apex coordinates).

   The parallel processing strategy adopted is to let main program
glowdriver.f90 handle all MPI calls, so that the core subroutines can be used
in either multiple or single-processor mode.  The 0th task performs all
I/O and empirical model calls, distributes variables to the other tasks,
collects the results, and outputs them to a netCDF file.  The domain
decomposition is one-dimensional in latitude.  The number of tasks (processors)
must be an integral multiple of the number of latitudes.  Since a typical 5x5
degree grid has 36 latitudes, 4, 6 or 12 processors are good numbers to use.
Note that on the new NCAR Cheyenne supercomputer, one node has 36 cores!
The number of processors is configurable in the job script runglow.job.

   Versions of NRLMSISE-00 and IRI-90 are provided for the convenience of users
who do not have their own copies.  Attribution to the appropriate sources
(Picone et al, 2002; Belitza, 1990) should be made.  The version of IRI
provided is not the standard version, as I have modified it to work on various
systems, particularly volatile memory systems.  However, I cannot guarantee
that the results obtained from them are correct.  Caution: IRI occasionally
writes messages on unit 12.  IRI data files ccir*.asc and ursi*.asc
are contained in ./data/iri90/ and this directory or a different directory
can be specified in the namelist inputs.  MSIS and IRI are old-style Fortran
with common blocks, and hence are not appropriate for MPI implementation, so
they are called by glowdriver using the 0th processor only.  Since they are
very fast (compared to, e.g., etrans) this is a minimal performance loss.

   When using GCM inputs, note that the TIE-GCM altitude grid doesn't extend
below ~97 km, but electron transport calculations require a "sponge" layer, so
densities are extrapolated from ~79 km to ~97 km using an assumed constant scale
height of 6 km.  Temperatures, Electron density, and nitric oxide density are
assumed to be constant below the bottom of the grid.  Therefore, results below
~97 km should be ignored.  This is not a problem for the TIME-GCM since its
altitude grid extends down to ~30 km, but note that GLOW does not yet contain
full D-region chemistry or mesopause-region recombination emissions.  For
empirical model inputs, MSIS and IRI provide full altitude profiles, but NOEM
only extends from 100-150 km, so a constant value is used for nitric oxide
below 100 km, and a scale height assumption above 150 km.

   For TIE- or TIME-GCM runs that will be used for input to GLOW, secondary
history files should be employed.  It is possible to use primary histories
but not recommended, since no auroral parameters will be included.  The
following secondary history output fields should be specified: ZG, TN, TI, TE,
NE, O1, O2, N2, NO, N4S, N2D, HE, UN, VN, EFLUX, NFLUX, ALFA, CUSP, DRIZZLE.
Note that HE, UN, and VN are not used, but are passed through to
output.  The auroral parameters EFLUX, NFLUX, ALFA, CUSP, and DRIZZLE are
optional but should be included.  (CUSP and DRIZZLE are not yet used,
but may be soon.)  If ZG or N2 are ommitted, they will be calculated by
readtgcm, provided that HE is included.

   The default energy grid extends to 50 keV and is appropriate for most
photoelectron and auroral calculations; the electron energy grid can extend
(in principle) to 1 GeV.  The altitude grid may be altered to suit the user's
needs, but with caution.  The two biggest pitfalls are not providing enough
resolution and not providing a deep enough atmosphere.  There should be no
significant flux of electrons out of the bottom of the altitude grid.  As for
resolution, a rule of thumb is about four points per scale height. 

   The ETRANS error code IERR and energy conservation ratio EFRAC
should be checked for normal return.  IERR should equal zero; if it doesn't
it means that the total inelastic cross section is near zero somewhere, which
is usually caused by a near zero ambient electron density.  EFRAC should be
less than ~0.03 for photoelectron calculations, and less than ~0.1 for aurora.
It can get up to the 0.1-0.2 range in the twilight, which is not good, but at
present unavoidable.
  
   Electron density calculations can be made by GCHEM below 200 km but not
above where transport/diffusion effects become important.  Therefore, an
electron density profile (such as from the NCAR TIE-GCM or from IRI) must be
provided above 200 km.  An initial non-zero electron density profile must be
provided at all altitudes in array ZE because otherwise ETRANS will produce
an error.  Calculated electron densities are returned in array ECALC, with
values from ZE included where calculations are not made.  The switch KCHEM
determines what ion/electron density calculations are made (see subroutine
GCHEM).  With the exception of KCHEM=0 (no calculations), none are foolproof.
One irritation that may be noted when KCHEM=4 (calculate Ne below 200 but use
provided Ne above 200) is a discontinuity in Ne(z) at 200 km.  GCHEM attempts
to deal with this by interpolating from the 200 km level to three grid
points above it.  Another caveat with KCHEM=4 or KCHEM=3 (Ne provided,
ions calculated) is that if there is an incompatibility between the specifed
Ne(z) and the calculated ionization rates, negative values for some ions may
result.  KCHEM=2 (electrons and major ions provided, minor ions calculated) and
KCHEM=1 (electrons and all ions except O+(2D,2P) provided) should be fairly
reliable.

   For daytime calculations, the parameter XUVFAC is provided to deal with the
uncertainty concerning the solar spectrum from 18-250 A.  When the
Hinteregger et al. [1981] model is employed, a reasonable value for XUVFAC is
2.0, as suggested by Richards et al. [1984; 1994], however a value as high as
4.0 might be realistic, as discussed by Solomon et al. [2001].  When the
EUVAC model [Richards et al., 1994] is employed, XUVFAC is only applied
to the region still obtained from the Hinteregger model, 18-50 A, since
longward of that point EUVAC has already increased the solar fluxes relative
to the Hinteregger spectrum (by factors of 2-3).  SSFLUX also now provides
the ability for the user to specify a solar spectrum from other models or
measurements, in which case XUVFAC is ignored.  The number of bins in the
solar spectrum input file must be equal to LMAX (specified in glow.h) and
the wavelength ranges must correspond to those in ephoto_x*.dat.

   The upper boundary of the electron transport calculation by ETRANS is
specified by the PHITOP array, which may contain a flux of auroral electrons,
conjugate photoelectrons, or both.  The initial electron density profile
input for the call to GLOW can be replaced by the calculated profile below
200 km, and GLOW called again.  This isn't really necessary, but gives an
improved estimate of the low-energy electron flux (which depends on the ambient
electron density), since IRI isn't really valid in the auroral regions.
For high-energy calculations this second call may safely be skipped.

   The example programs use the NOEM model of nitric oxide, based on data from
the SNOE satellite, as an empirical input [Marsh et al., 2004].  When running
from GCM fields the NO calculated by the GCM is used.
  
   Electron impact cross sections generated by EXSECT can be obtained from
variables use associated through the CGLOW module.

   A note on units:  GLOW uses cgs in its internal calculations.  Wavelengths
are described in nanometers in this publication, but Angstroms are used for 
solar and airglow emission wavelengths inside the code.  Energies are in 
electron volts (eV), except for the input auroral total energy flux, which is 
expressed in erg cm-2 (equivalent to mW m-2).  Other units employed for 
convenience are megabarns (10-18 cm2) and Rayleighs (106 photons cm-2).  
Conductivities are output in Siemens/meter (mhos).  Kilometers are used in 
driver program altitude grids, but are converted to centimeters internally.  
Dates are in yyyyddd or optionally yyddd format, universal time 
is in seconds, and local solar time is in hours.  The solar radio 
flux index F10.7 is in expressed in units of 10-22 W m-2.
